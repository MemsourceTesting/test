Due to the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be gradually implemented over upcoming releases.

				</simpara>
				<simpara>
					Verify if your product is compatible with new minor releases (4. x) of OpenShift and check if it is working after a platform upgrade. The Operator packaging format captures the compatibility information as a part of the metadata, so users can know the supported versions of OpenShift and set upgrade policies accordingly. For more details on encoding this information, see metadata requirements for <link linkend="con-operator-requirements_openshift-sw-cert-policy-products-managed">Operators</link>.
				</simpara>
				<simpara>
					Recertify your Operator for major releases of your product or on the addition of new functionality that warrants repeating the verification tests.
				</simpara>
				<simpara>
					Verify the content of individual components (containers) continuously to mitigate security risks. Red Hat provides this as a service for all certified containers, constantly monitoring to identify any critical vulnerabilities (CVEs) for all the Red Hat packages.

					<simpara>
						You can deploy and manage the CSI driver on Red Hat OpenShift through an Operator and it must meet the requirements described in this document. The requirements to use certified operands (containers) also apply to the driverâ€™s sidecar images. You should build and maintain their sidecar images so they can meet this criterion. You can select a sidecar image published and maintained by Red Hat, available as a part of OpenShift. If you do so, verify the interoperability of your CSI driver with the sidecars, as well as test and incorporate sidecar updates when available.
